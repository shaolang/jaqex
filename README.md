# Jaqex
Elixir wrapper for [jaq](https://github.com/01mf02/jaq), a [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
clone focussed on correctness, speed, and simplicity implemented in Rust.

Unlike other jq wrappers, this doesn't require jq to be installed/available in `$PATH`:
Jaqex uses [rustler](https://hexdocs.pm/rustler/) to implement the NIFs to jaq.
And because Jaqex uses jaq, certain jq features like SQL-style operators aren't available.
Please refer to [jaq's README "differences between jq and jaq"][diff]
for more information.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `jaqex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:jaqex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/jaqex>.
